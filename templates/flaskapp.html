            <h2>Project Intro & Goals</h2>
            <p>
                This project analyzes data about vehicle accidents in the US, UK and
                France with the goal of informing users about patterns in these
                accidents and potentially how to prevent them. Users of this tool might
                include governmental authorities and organizations, such as the
                Department of Transportation in the US, the Secretary of State for
                Transport in the UK, and the Minister of Transportation in France. These
                government bodies might use these visualizations to understand the
                circumstances around traffic accidents, which might help them develop
                new policies or regulations to improve road safety. This tool is also
                available to the general public so that they can make informed decisions
                about where or when they drive and under what conditions, if they have
                flexibility to choose. While this project is not a study of causation,
                we hope that by understanding correlations in traffic accidents, our
                users can understand the circumstances around more frequent and more
                severe accidents.
            </p>
            <h2>Datasets</h2>
            <p>Our datasets combined vary over time, with the US spanning from 2016 to 2021, the UK from 2005 to
                2014
                (except 2008), and France from 2005 to 2016. We obtained these datasets through Kaggle, and they can
                be
                found here: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents">US dataset</a>, <a
                    href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/daveianhickey/2000-16-traffic-flow-england-scotland-wales">UK
                    dataset</a>, <a
                    href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahmedlahlou/accidents-in-france-from-2005-to-2016">France
                    dataset</a>.</p>
            <h2>Data Cleaning</h2>
            <p>We had to clean and process these datasets in order to get them in a usable format to draw
                conclusions from
                intranational accidents and to make international comparisons. For example, in the UK dataset, we
                had to
                drop duplicate accidents and merge separate datasets across years to create one continuous dataset.
                For
                France, we merged separate datasets with different accident characteristics, including holidays,
                places,
                users, and vehicles.
                Finally, to combine the separate datasets for each country together, we identified common features
                across
                all countries and standardized the values to make comparisons. There were three themes of features
                that were
                found in each country: time-based features, weather data, and road type information. These themes
                inspired
                three of our Tableau visualization dashboards.</p>

            <h2>Accident Severity</h2>
            <p>Additionally, each dataset had a measurement of accident severity, which had varying scales for each
                country.
                We standardized this feature across the countries to allow users to understand correlations between
                accident
                conditions and severity. The US’s severity metric actually measured the accident’s impact on
                traffic, which
                we assumed could be generalized to the severity of the accident itself. The US and France measured
                severity
                on a scale from 1 to 4, while the UK measured severity on a scale from 1 to 3. For consistency, we
                converted
                all countries to a 1 to 3 scale with the following interpretations:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>1: minor accident</li>
                <li>2: severe accident</li>
                <li>3: extreme or fatal accident</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Variable Types</h2>
            <ul style="list-style-type:none">
                <li>Weather: What was the weather when the accident occurred?
                </li>
                <li>Road Type: What type of road did the accident take place on?
                </li>
                <li>Road Condition: What was the condition of the road that the accident took place on?
                </li>
                <li>Light: What time of day did the accident occur?
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h1 id="temporal">Visualizations</h1>
            <h2>Time</h2>
            <p>These graphs below display the number of accidents across different time frames. The first graph shows
                the number of accidents by month, color-coded by year. The bottom left graph shows the percent of
                accidents in a country based on the day of week. The bottom right graph shows the percent of accidents
                in a country based on the hour of day. Click on the Weather, Light, Road Type, and Road Condition
                filters to view the correlation of such variables on accident frequency.</p>

            <h2>Weather</h2>
            <p>In the Tableau dashboard below, we analyze correlations between accident severity and different weather
                conditions, including the weather itself (ex. clear, foggy, rainy, snowy, etc.), lighting conditions
                (ex. day versus night), and road conditions (ex. dry, flooded, icy, snowy, or wet). There is some
                correlation between weather and road conditions–for example, when it is rainy, the road is most likely
                wet–but we included both conditions since the US was entirely missing road conditions but the road
                conditions still provided a unique perspective about what drivers are facing on the road.
                These histograms compare accident severity across different conditions. Each histogram chart has a
                “baseline” category: clear for the weather histogram, daylight for the light histogram, and dry for the
                road conditions histogram. The bars represent the percent change in average severity compared to this
                baseline condition. For example, in France, foggy weather conditions are on average 17% more severe than
                clear conditions. Government officials in France might see this observation and conclude that it could
                be helpful for vehicles in France to have better headlights that allow drivers to see better through
                fog.</p>
